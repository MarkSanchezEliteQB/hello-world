hello world

Hello, beginning programmer with basic knowledge of Python, Java, Javascript, and Matlab here looking to become a better developer.

January 2019: Starting to upload personal projects I have made to share. I have taken a few python courses as well as Data Science & Machine Learning courses with Python too. I have experience with most of the common ML algorithms as well as Data Analysis with Pandas for Python and some financial analysis as well.
Most of my projects I develop in a Jupyter notebook, especially data science projects so I can visualize and analyze data line by line.
